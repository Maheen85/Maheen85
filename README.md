Hello. I am Maheen Shaikh [@Maheen85] a Bachelor in CS&IT.

I find the process of software development very interesting. I like to learn bit by bit from ideation, analysis, identifying requirement all the way to creating conceptual models - identifying objects ,abstractions ,class relationships etc

I like to set goals for my self both professional and personal. This keeps me motivated to better myself by constant learning, growth and development. 

Thanks for visiting my profile.
